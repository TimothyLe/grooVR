#### Unity3d
Unity3d is a cross-platform, real-time game engine on which GrooVR is built off of. It supports Android and iPhone app development, however GrooVR is only officially supported on Android.

#### React Native
React Native is a framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. Using React Native allows you to build your app faster while developing.

#### Modifying Source
